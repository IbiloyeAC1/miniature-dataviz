#R is good for flexible statistical Modeling and parameters estimation. (Valid and # reproducible results are achievable.)
#Example 1:

#R Codes:
# Let the protected well be 'p' and the unprotected well be 'u'
#an researcher selected two well from each village, A and B.
#We wish, by MLE concept, shows the possibilities in n=5000 trials.

<villageA = c('p','p','p','u','u','u','u','u')>
villageB = c('p', 'p','p','p','p','p','u','u')
event = c() #selecting randomly any well which are unprotected.
event2= c() # randomly selecting only one unprotected well in village A
for(i in 1:5000) {
  first.draw = sample(villageA,2)
  first.draw2= sample(villageB,2)
  first.draw12=sample(villageA,1)
newballs = c(villageA,first.draw)
newballs2=c(villageB,first.draw2)
second.draw = sample(newballs,1)
event[i] = (first.draw==c('u','u') && first.draw2==c('u','u'))
event2[i] = (first.draw12=='u' && second.draw=="p")}
